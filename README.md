# Investigating-Bikeshare-Data

Thank you for taking a look at my project, This project is a python script used for exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington to answer some statistical questions related to this data.

this datasets provided by [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/) contain data about 300001 bike trip for each city with trip start and end time, trip duration, start and end staion etc...

the script ask you about city you want to explore it data and filter it by month and day if you need a certain month or day to explore in. then, it give you:
* the most frequent times of travel (note that if you filter data by certain month or day. it will show it as the most popular). 
* the most popular stations and trip.
* the total and average trip duration.
* some informations about bikeshare users.

then it ask you if you want to see some rows from the filtered dataset.
